# Multi-branch Neural Network for image classification.
Project developed for the course "Advanced topics in Machine Learning" at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana.
The aim of the project is a reproducibility challenge of the paper ["Differentiable branching in deep networks for fast inference"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9054209) by professor S. Scardapane et al., DIET Department, Sapienza University of Rome.
